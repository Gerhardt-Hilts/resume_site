      You want me on your team. I will make your life easier. Your pipeline smoother. Your frontend prettier. Your backend clean. I've done it before and I'll do it again, no sweat. There is always room for improvement. I'm the guy that finds out how to improve on perfection. Haven't reached a perfect product yet? I will take you there. Throw me at that horrifyingly complex project. I'll square it away so smoothly, you'll forget other shapes exist!
      So why is it that I'm so conclusive on my abilities?
      If you don't know what to think about what I've done, I'll tell you what to think. "WOW! This guy is in control. He's got it down. I'm bringing this guy on board asap!"
      Look at all this stuff I've done.
